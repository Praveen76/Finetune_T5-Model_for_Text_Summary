# Finetune_T5-Model_for_Text_Summary


This repository is focused on fine-tuning the T5 model, along with the BART-large-cnn from Facebook, for the task of text summarization on the SAMSum dataset. All code and explanations are contained within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this experiment, you will be able to:
- Fine-tune a T5 model and BART-large-cnn on the SAMSum dataset for summarization.
- Push the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face model hub.
- Load the fine-tuned model from the hub for inference.

## Dataset Description

The SAMSum dataset includes approximately 16,000 messenger-like conversations with summaries. These conversations were designed by linguists fluent in English to reflect the variety and style of real-life messenger conversations. Summaries provided with the conversations offer concise third-person descriptions of the dialogue content.

### Data Splits
- **Train**: 14,732 samples
- **Validation**: 818 samples
- **Test**: 819 samples

### Data Fields
- `dialogue`: The text of the dialogue.
- `summary`: Human-written summary of the dialogue.
- `id`: Unique ID for each example.

### Example
```json
{
  "id": "13818513",
  "summary": "Amanda baked cookies and will bring Jerry some tomorrow.",
  "dialogue": "Amanda: I baked cookies. Do you want some?\r\nJerry: Sure!\r\nAmanda: I'll bring you tomorrow :-)"
}
```

## How to Use

### Requirements
Ensure you have Python and the following packages installed:
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `datasets`

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets
```

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Finetune_T5-Model_for_Text_Summary.git
cd Finetune_T5-Model_for_Text_Summary
```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the `Finetune_T5model_for_Text_Summary.ipynb` file.

3. **Follow the Instructions in the Notebook:**
   - The notebook includes detailed steps for loading the data, training the model, pushing the model to the Hugging Face Hub, and performing inference.
